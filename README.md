Project after simpli-recipes. 
Will be a clone of Guns.com. 
A solid plan is in place for the layout of the landing page. 
Interactivity will be focused on after layout is complete.


UPDATE: 9/28/2023
I have constructed several complex components that make up the 
landing page of guns.com. I am happy with the way things are looking
and I spent today implementing user authorization with firebase. After
further inspection of the sign-in/sign-up process of guns.com it 
appears it is more complex than I anticipated. Also my understanding of 
how user authentication all ties in together is not yet developed enough for
such complexitys. 
  For these resons I have decided to move back to the recipe project so
that I can experiment with user auth more freely since it is a project
without a definate design.
